# Flory project: is an website of selling flowers online "first time of uploading >> Flory project &lt;&lt; after some updates".

Hi everyone, We developed a Flory site project which contains flowers to all occasions for our web programming course.
To enter the site, you must first sign up(create a new account if you don't have one) as a user only and from this you go to log in to enter the same informations then you go to captcha page to ensure that you are not a robot and finally you go to the user page or log in( if you already have an account) and from this you go to user page(but captcha page before), admin page or super admin page! How?!
Let's discuss this point! 

We made a super admin which his/her informations(Email: admin@gmail.com, Password: admin) were already saved in the database. When you log in with the super admin 's informations, you go to the super admin page who manges admin pages and user pages. When you log in with admin's informations which were added by the super admin, you go to the admin page who manages user pages. And when you log in with user's informations, you go to the user page. Let's discuss what these pages(Super Admin, Admin, User) contain!

# (Before this, i want to say that this is Areej_Elghraz ‚ô°'s idea‚ú®).

-As a Super admin, the site contains six sections: Home section, Admin section which contains admin accounts, user section which contains user accounts, Messages Section which contains the messages users sent, Products Section which will allow adding new products ,and Orders Section which contains the orders that users ordered. 

-The difference between Super admin page and admin page is that admin page has five sections only(not six) because it doesn't contain admin section. But other sections are the same. And we want to obtain that all sections that super admin and admin contain have the access on them, can add, edit or delete, briefly manage every thing !

-As a User, the site contains six sections ,too: Home section which is the main section, About section, Reviews section which contains some opinions from our clients, Departments section, Contact section to contact us if you want to tell us something or face any problem with our site ,and Shopping section which was divided into departments

# (Weddings, Lovers, New Baby, Decoration and Get Well Soon), 

every department contains products(flowers) which were added by the super admin and admin. We divided the project into two parts: the front-end part and the back-end part (full) that were done by 

# Areej_Elghraz ‚ô° ,Esraa_Elfar and Nour_Mohsen.

# I want to thank Areej_Elghraz ‚ô° (the team leader 'THE BEST' üò©‚ù§Ô∏è) for her efforts on this project ,she do all her best to arrive to this result, thanks alot reejaüíò.
